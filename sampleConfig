# Configuration file for the AAT.
#
# The next options are for determining the course of the test.
#
# Trials - defines the number of trails
# BreakAfter - after how much Trails the test is on a break. Set this to a higher number than the trails
#	       if a break is not necessary.
# PracticeRepeat - How many practice images are needed at the beginning of the test. The total number of images
# 		   Shown is twice this amount. (Every image has a pull and push variant). Comment this or set to 0 when you don't want a practice.
# DisplayQuestions - Should the questions be asked Before or After the test. Set to None for no questions
# ShowBoxPlot - Set this to True when you want to display a boxplot showing the results, otherwise set to False

Trials 4
BreakAfter 2
PracticeRepeat 3
DisplayQuestions None
ShowBoxPlot True

#The next two options are only needed when you want to change the ratio push/pull in the two conditions (push:pull). Default is 50% push and 50% #pull 1:1 ratio.


AffectRatio 1:1
NeutralRatio 1:1

#This option specifies the ratio of Affective vs Neutral images (Affect:Neutral). Default is a 1:1 ratio. 


TestRatio 1:1

#This option sets the number of images shown in each trial. Normally this options doesnt need to be set. Only needed when you change the ratio('s)
#and want a specified number of images in each trial

# TrialSize 20

#The next options are for the way images should be shown on screen. A test can use the build in method that can create a colored border around
#an image.
# ColoredBorders - If this is set to True, the program will show a colored border around the image
# BorderColorPush - Determines the color to be used for the push images. Color is in hex value.
# BorderColorPull - Same for the pull images.
# BorderWidth - Specifies the width the border has in the center position.
# PracticeFillColor - Specifies the color the practice image gets. This only works if the PracticeDir is not set


ColoredBorders True
BorderColorPush F5FE02
BorderColorPull 00A4E7
BorderWidth 20
PracticeFillColor FFDEDE

# PullTag & PushTag - These are needed when ColoredBorders is set to False. Image file names should contain these tags.

# PullTag pull
# PushTag push

#Next options are for the specification of directories
# AffectiveDir - This is the directory containing the affective images
# NeutralDir - The directory containing the neutral images
# PracticeDir - A directory containing Practice images. If this is not set, the program will use self-generated images with the specified fill
# color. It will also use the border colors that are specified. 


AffectiveDir NA
NeutralDir NA
# PracticeDir practice

#The next option specifies in which file the data will be saved. When not set it will default to Data.xml

# Data.xml
#It is possible for the same test to have different languages. 
#LanguageFile specifies the language file used for this test. Change this value to another language file for the test to be performed in a 
#different language.

LanguageFile NA

#When a questionnaire is added to the AAT, the next option specifies which file contains those questions. 

# Questionnaire questionnaire.xml

#Next options are for test performance
# StepSize - Determines in how many steps the image is resized. This has to be an odd number. A higher number is smoother, but setting this  
#	     too high can be bad for performance. (Defaults to 31 when not set)
# DataSteps - Determines the accuracy for data recording. Higher value means smaller movements are recorded, but this also increases
#	     the error rate. (Defaults to 9 when not set)
# MaxSizePerc - Determines how large the image can be. Value is percentage of the screen height. Can be >100% (Default 100%)
# ImageSizePerc - Determines how large the image will be when first shown on the screen. Value is percentage of the screen height. Can be >100%
#		  (Default 50%)

StepSize 31
DataSteps 9
MaxSizePerc 100
ImageSizePerc 50


# Unique ID value. This value is used to determine whether this file has changed since the last time the test was taken.
ID 123456
